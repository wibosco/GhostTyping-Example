# GhostTyping-Example

An example project to show how we can implement a character-by-character animation, as shown in this article http://williamboles.me/ghost-typing-your-way-to-hollywood/

---

I decided to expand this example project and turn it into a [cocoapod (GhostTypewriter)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/GhostTypewriter) so that it could be more easily reused. If you have never used [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), its a dependency management tool that allows you to inject third party frameworks/libraries into your project - you should check it out.
